## Serverless experiment using Go and GraphQL

*Note! This is purely an experiment and not meant for production use.*

The purpose of this experiment is to explore other alternatives to the container based serverless pattern. We are hoping this solution will minimize the overhead needed for spinning up a new container on demand and fully eliminate the idea of a "cold start".

More to come soon!
